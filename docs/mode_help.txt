USAGE:

    metacache <MODE> [OPTION...]

    Available modes:

    help        shows documentation 
    query       classify read sequences using pre-built database
    merge       merge classification results of independent queries
    build       build new database from reference sequences (usually genomes)
    modify      add reference sequences and/or taxonomy to existing database
    info        show database and reference sequence properties


EXAMPLES:

    Query single FASTA file 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        metacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt
    same with output to the console:
        metacache query refseq myreads.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst database 'refseq':
        metacache query refseq test -out results.txt

    Query paired-end reads in separate files:
        metacache query refseq reads1.fa reads2.fa -pairfiles -out results.txt

    Query paired-end reads in one file (a1,a2,b1,b2,...):
        metacache query refseq paired_reads.fa -pairseq -out results.txt
