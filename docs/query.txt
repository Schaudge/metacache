Documentation for MetaCache mode "query"

SYNOPSIS:
    Map sequences (short reads) to their most likely origin.

SYNTAX:
    metacache query <database name> {<query sequence>} {[option]}

    You can also provide names of directories that contain
    sequence files instead of single filenames. MetaCache will
    search at most 10 levels down in the file hierarchy.

OPTIONS:
    -out <filename>    Redirect output to file <filename>.
                       If not specified, output will be written to stdout.

    -splitout          Generate output and statistics for each input file
                       separately. The name of the input file will be appended
                       to the output filename (see '-out').
                       default: off

    -pairfiles         Interleave paired-end reads from two consecutive files,
                       so that the nth read from file m and the nth read
                       from file m+1 will be treated as a pair.
                       If more than two files are provided, their names
                       will be sorted before processing. Thus, the order
                       defined by the filenames determines the pairing not
                       the order in which they were given in the command line.

    -pairseq          Two consecutive sequences (1+2, 3+4, ...) from each file
                       will be treated as paired-end reads.

    -insertsize        Maximum insert size to consider.
                       default: sum of lengths of the individual reads

    -lowest  <rank>    Do not classify on ranks below <rank>.
                       default: sequence

    -highest <rank>    Do not classify on ranks above <rank>.
                       default: domain

    -positions         Show positions in candidate reference genomes.

    -kmercount         Use all-kmer-counting for ambiguous cases.
                       Reference genome sequence files must be available.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -align             Use semi-global alignment for ambiguous cases.
                       Reference genome sequence files must be available.
                       This will drastically decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -lineage           Report complete lineage for per-read classification
                       starting with the lowest rank found or allowed and
                       ending with the highest rank allowed. See also
                       options '-lowest' and '-highest'.
                       default: off

    -ground_truth      Report correct query taxa, if known.
                       Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                       their header or a sequence id that is also found in
                       the database.
                       default: off

    -precision         Report true positive classification rate (PPV)
                       by comparing query taxa (ground truth) and mapped taxa.
                       Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                       their header or a sequence id that is also found in
                       the database.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -coverage          Also report true/false positives and true/false negatives.
                       This option will turn on '-precision'.
                       default: off

    -tophits           Print top hash hits in database.
                       default: off

    -allhits           Print all hash hits in database.
                       default: off

    -taxids            Print taxon ids in addition to taxon names.
                       default: off

    -taxids_only       Print taxon ids instead of taxon names.
                       default: off

    -nomap             Don't report classification for each individual query
                       sequence; show summaries only (useful for quick tests).
                       default: off

    -separator <text>  string that separates output fields (sequence name, 
                       ground truth, classification result, etc.)
                       default: "\t|\t"

    -winlen <no>       number of letters in each sampling window
                       default: same as for reference genomes in database

    -winstride <no>    distance between window starting positions
                       default: same as for reference genomes in database

    -sketchlen <no>    number of k-mers per window
                       default: all k-mers in query sequence

    -exclude <rank>    Mask out query rank from database if ground truth known
                       (see '-precision').
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -threads <no>      use <no> many parallel threads
                       default: guess optimum for hardware


EXAMPLES:
    Query all sequences in 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt

    Query all sequences in multiple files against database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq reads1.fna reads2.fna reads3.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq test

    Query multiple files and folder contents against database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq file1.fna folder1 file2.fna file3.fna folder2

    Perform a precision test and show all ranks for each classification result:
        ./metacache query refseq reads.fna -precision -allranks -out results.txt
