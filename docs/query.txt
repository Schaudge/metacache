Documentation for MetaCache mode "query"

SYNOPSIS
    metacache query <database name> [<query sequence>...] OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
    Map sequences (short reads) to their most likely origin.

    You can also provide names of directories that contain
    sequence files instead of single filenames. MetaCache will
    search at most 10 levels down in the file hierarchy.

    If no input sequence filenames or directories are given, MetaCache will
    run in interactive query mode. This can be used to load the database into
    memory only once and then query it multiple times with different
    query options.

BASIC OPTIONS
    -out <file>        Redirect output to file <file>.
                       If not specified, output will be written to stdout.
                       If more than one input file was given all output
                       will be concatenated into one file.

    -splitout <file>   Generate output and statistics for each input file
                       separately. For each input file <in> an output file 
                       <file>_<in> will be written.

    -pairfiles         Interleave paired-end reads from two consecutive files,
                       so that the nth read from file m and the nth read
                       from file m+1 will be treated as a pair.
                       If more than two files are provided, their names
                       will be sorted before processing. Thus, the order
                       defined by the filenames determines the pairing not
                       the order in which they were given in the command line.

    -pairseq           Two consecutive sequences (1+2, 3+4, ...) from each file
                       will be treated as paired-end reads.

    -insertsize        Maximum insert size to consider.
                       default: sum of lengths of the individual reads

    -lowest  <rank>    Do not classify on ranks below <rank>.
                       default: sequence

    -highest <rank>    Do not classify on ranks above <rank>.
                       default: domain

    -hitmin <t>        Sets classification threshhold to <t>.
                       A read will not be classified if less than t features
                       from the database are found in it.
                       Higher values will increase precision at the expense of
                       lower sensitivity.

OUTPUT FORMATTING OPTIONS

    -nomap             Don't report classification for each individual query
                       sequence; show summaries only (useful for quick tests).
                       default: off

    -mapped-only       Don't list unclassified queries.
                       default: off

    -taxids            Print taxon ids in addition to taxon names.
                       default: off

    -taxids-only       Print taxon ids instead of taxon names.
                       default: off

    -separate-cols     Prints *all* mapping information (rank, taxon name, taxon ids)
                       in separate columns (see option "-separator").
                       default: off

    -separator <text>  string that separates output fields (sequence name, 
                       classification result, etc.)
                       default: "\t|\t"

    -locations         Show locations in candidate reference genomes.
                       default: off

    -lineage           Report complete lineage for per-read classification
                       starting with the lowest rank found or allowed and
                       ending with the highest rank allowed. See also
                       options '-lowest' and '-highest'.
                       default: off

    -tophits           Print top feature hits in database.
                       default: off

    -allhits           Print all feature hits in database.
                       default: off

ADVANCED OPTIONS 

    -threads <no>      use <no> many parallel threads
                       default: automatic

    -batch-size <no>   process <no> many reads per thread;
                       This can be used for performance tuning.
                       default: automatic 
    
    -query-limit <no>  Classify at max. <no> reads per file.
                       This can be used for quick tests.
                       default: off

    -winlen <no>       number of letters in each sampling window
                       default: same as for reference genomes in database

    -winstride <no>    distance between window starting positions
                       default: same as for reference genomes in database

    -sketchlen <no>    number of features per window
                       default: same as in database

    -ground-truth      Report correct query taxa if known.
                       Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                       their header or a sequence id that is also present in
                       the database.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -precision         Report precision & sensitivity
                       by comparing query taxa (ground truth) and mapped taxa.
                       Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                       their header or a sequence id that is also found in
                       the database.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -coverage          Also report true/false positives and true/false negatives.
                       This option will turn on '-precision'.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -align             Record semi-global alignment scores for best candidate
                       target and show statistics.
                       Reference genome sequence files must be available.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -showalign         Show semi-global alignment for best candidate target.
                       Reference genome sequence files must be available.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

EXAMPLES
    Query all sequences in 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt

    Query all sequences in multiple files against database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq reads1.fna reads2.fna reads3.fna
