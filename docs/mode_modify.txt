SYNOPSIS

    metacache modify <database> <reference sequence>... [OPTION]...


DESCRIPTION

    Add reference sequence and/or taxonomic information to an existing database.


REQUIRED

    <database>        database file name

    <reference sequence>...
                      FASTA or FASTQ files containing genomic sequences
                      You can also provide names of directories that contain
                      sequence files instead of single filenames. MetaCache will
                      search at most 10 levels deep in the file hierarchy.


BASIC OPTIONS

    -taxonomy <path>  directory with taxonomic hierarchy data (see NCBI's
                      taxonomic data files)

    -taxpostmap <file>
                      Files with sequence to taxon id mappings that are used as
                      alternative source in a post processing step.
                      default: 'nucl_(gb|wgs|est|gss).accession2taxid'

    -silent|-verbose  information level during build:
                      silent=none / verbose=most detailed


ADVANCED OPTIONS

    -reset-parents    Attempts to re-rank all sequences after the main build
                      phase using '.accession2taxid' files. This will reset the
                      taxon id of a reference sequence even if a taxon id could
                      be obtained from other sources during the build phase.
                      default: off

    -max-locations-per-feature <#>
                      maximum number of target locations to be stored per
                      feature;
                      If the value is too high it will significantly impact
                      querying speed. Note that an upper hard limit is always
                      imposed by the data type used for the hash table bucket
                      size (set with compilation macro
                      '-DMC_LOCATION_LIST_SIZE_TYPE').
                      default: 254

    -remove-overpopulated-features
                      Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed
                      amount of locations per feature. This can improve querying
                      speed and can be used to remove non-discriminative
                      features.
                      default: off

    -remove-ambig-features <rank>
                      Removes all features that have more distinct targets on
                      the given taxonomic rank than set by
                      '-max-ambig-per-feature'. This can decrease the database
                      size significantly at the expense of sensitivity. Note
                      that the lower the given taxonomic rank is, the more
                      pronounced the effect will be.
                      Valid values: sequence, form, variety, subspecies,
                      species, subgenus, genus, subtribe, tribe, subfamily,
                      family, suborder, order, subclass, class, subphylum,
                      phylum, subkingdom, kingdom, domain
                      default: off

    -max-ambig-per-feature <#>
                      Maximum number of allowed different target taxa per
                      feature if option '-remove-ambig-features' is used.

    -max-load-fac <factor>
                      maximum hash table load factor;
                      This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                      for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve
                      speed, a larger one will improve memory efficiency.
                      default: 0.800000

    Add taxonomic information from NCBI to database 'myBacteria'
        download_ncbi_taxonomy myTaxo
        metacache modify myBacteria -taxonomy myTaxo
