You need to specify one of the following modes:
    help        shows documentation 
    query       classify read sequences using pre-built database
    build       build new database from reference genomes
    add         add reference genomes and/or taxonomy to existing database
    info        show database and reference genome properties
    annotate    annotate sequences with taxonomic information 

EXAMPLES:
    Query 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq myreads.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst pre-built database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq test

    View documentation for all query options:
        ./metacache help query

    View documentation on how to build databases:
